# üß† Day 4 ‚Äî AWS IAM Best Practices & Policy Boundaries

## üéì Professor Mode: Concept Deep Dive

After mastering IAM users, groups, and roles, it‚Äôs time to **tighten control** and apply governance-level best practices.

Think of IAM governance as the **guardrails** that prevent misuse ‚Äî even by admins.

### üß© Key Best Practices

| Category | Best Practice | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Root Account** | Never use root for daily tasks | Root has unrestricted power |
| **MFA** | Enforce MFA on all users & root | Prevents credential theft |
| **Least Privilege** | Give only what‚Äôs needed | Reduces attack surface |
| **Access Reviews** | Rotate keys & review access quarterly | Detect privilege creep |
| **Policy Boundaries** | Cap permissions users or roles can have | Enforces max permission limits |
| **IAM Access Analyzer** | Detect overly permissive policies | Prevents accidental exposure |

## üß± Architect Mode: Hands-On Lab

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Policy Boundary (Permission Guardrail)
```bash
nano policy-boundary.json
Paste:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "iam:*",
        "organizations:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Policy Boundary
bash
Copy code
aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name DeveloperBoundary \
  --policy-document file://policy-boundary.json
Copy the returned ARN ‚Äî you‚Äôll use it below.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Attach the Boundary to a User
bash
Copy code
aws iam put-user-permissions-boundary \
  --user-name CloudEngineer \
  --permissions-boundary arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:policy/DeveloperBoundary
‚úÖ Now even if CloudEngineer tries to attach admin policies, AWS blocks it.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify
bash
Copy code
aws iam get-user --user-name CloudEngineer
You‚Äôll see "PermissionsBoundary" in the output.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Audit Access with IAM Access Analyzer
bash
Copy code
aws accessanalyzer create-analyzer \
  --analyzer-name BoundaryAudit \
  --type ACCOUNT
Then:

bash
Copy code
aws accessanalyzer list-findings --analyzer-name BoundaryAudit
